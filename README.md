# [Digital Library Management System]

Library management is always a challenging endeavor, and with the growing number of 
students, improved library management is essential. The smart library management system 
aims to improve library management in a city or community. "What if, instead of travelling 
to the library, you could check whether a book is available online?" or "through your device, 
you can renew or issue a book." You can use your device to issue, renew, or return a book 
from a library using the Integrated smart Library Management system


The project's main goal is to keep track of information about books and library members. 
This database management system (DBMS) software that we designed allows us to 
maintain an easy circulation system between clients and libraries, to issue books with just 
a registered login, to search and renew any book from libraries, and to keep track of user 
information. Furthermore, the user can access all of these capabilities directly from their 
device.
